Is the following conjecture reasonable and/or provable? :

Given a sequence of digits, starting with a non-zero digit, of arbitrary
but finite length, is it always possible to extend this sequence by
appending more digits, in such a way as to form a prime?#! rnews 1312

Is the following conjecture reasonable and/or provable? :

Given a sequence of digits, starting with a non-zero digit, of arbitrary
but finite length, is it always possible to extend this sequence by
appending more digits, in such a way as to form a pri°e?#! rnews 1312
